# Goals

Todo apps are a staple for a reason, there's a bunch of fundamental concepts needed to make one that works like you'd expect. I'm intending to make this a fun, modular project that has room to grow into a general productivity site with TODO, Kanban, and whatever else I think of handled under one auth scheme. Eventually the goal is to integrate everything into a user friendly all purpose tool and iterate on what people gain value from.

# TODO LIST Since my TODO app is still in the early stages :)

- Get basic page layout working
  - Add dark mode because dark mode
  - Could add whole app color customizations at some point
- Add code to componnets to make the basic display work (use dummy data)
  - Live site with info saved to local storage at this point.
- Setup db + ORM to start using real data
- Add Auth to handle multiple users
  - Update live site to be a full fledged app
- Integrate this with my Kanban App to make a productivity site
  - Have "Add to Kanban" button on Tasks (Use leftside Kanban pic)
- Check out if analytics can be routed back to the user, or create some way of displaying productivity data
  - Release combined app
